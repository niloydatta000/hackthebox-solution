# Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)


NTFS permissions on files and folders in Windows can be managed using the File Explorer GUI under the security tab. Apart from the GUI, we can also achieve a fine level of granularity over NTFS file permissions in Windows from the command line using the icacls utility.

We can list out the NTFS permissions on a specific directory by running either icacls from within the working directory or icacls C:\Windows against a directory not currently in.

The resource access level is listed after each user in the output. The possible inheritance settings are:

(CI): container inherit
(OI): object inherit
(IO): inherit only
(NP): do not propagate inherit
(I): permission inherited from parent container
In the above example, the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account has object inherit, container inherit, inherit only, and full access permissions. This means that this account has full control over all file system objects in this directory and subdirectories.

Basic access permissions are as follows:

F : full access
D :  delete access
N :  no access
M :  modify access
RX :  read and execute access
R :  read-only access
W :  write-only access

We can add and remove permissions via the command line using icacls. Here we are executing icacls in the context of a local administrator account showing the C:\users directory where the joe user does not have any write permissions.
